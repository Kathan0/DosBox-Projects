For operating Dosbox, first one needs to download Dosbox which can be followed from any simple tutorial on the Internet.

After downloading Dos-Box, mount the 'BIN folder' present in the MASM611 folder as E:
Syntax:->  
mount 'any letter': 'pathToBin'
'any Letter':
ml 'Name of file'.asm
(code compiles, and shows any possible errors. If no errors are present, move to next step, else check your code and reattempt the previous step)
debugx 'name of the file'.com
g / g = 'start address' 'end address'
